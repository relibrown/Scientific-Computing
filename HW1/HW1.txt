1) Write a computer program (MATLAB, Python, etc. of your choice) 
to generate an nth order polynomial function p(x).  
The program should take two parameters: 
1) Domain of the function p(x) and 
2) Roots of the polynomial function p(x).  In your program, also plot p(x).

i.e. your program should be able to generate any nth order polynomial
